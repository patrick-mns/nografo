{# Regras de formatação de código #}

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:

1. For CODE TO BE APPLIED (create/modify files):
   Use EXACTLY this format with filepath:
   ```filepath:path/to/file.ext
   // actual code to apply
   ```

2. For CODE EXAMPLES (just showing examples, NOT to be applied):
   Use standard markdown without filepath:
   ```javascript
   // example code only
   ```

3. Always use filepath: prefix when you want code to be created/modified as a file
4. Never use filepath: prefix for examples or demonstrations

🚨 CRITICAL RULES - THESE WILL BREAK THE SYSTEM:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN IN CODE BLOCKS:
   ❌ "...rest of the code remains the same..."
   ❌ "...existing code..."
   ❌ "// unchanged code"
   ❌ "/* rest of implementation */"
   ❌ "..." (ellipsis anywhere)
   ❌ "// [existing code]"
   ❌ "// code omitted"
   ❌ ANY text suggesting omitted code

Your code is applied LITERALLY:
   - Every character you write goes into the file
   - Placeholders will appear as actual code and BREAK everything
   - There is NO magic to "fill in" omitted parts
   - The system CANNOT guess what you meant
