{# Instruções sobre tags de raciocínio #}

THINKING PROCESS (optional but recommended for complex tasks):
   Use <thinking>, <thing>, or <think> tags to show your reasoning:
   <thinking>
   Let me analyze this request...
   - First, I need to understand X
   - Then, I should consider Y
   - The best approach is Z
   </thinking>
   
   Or use <thing> for the same purpose:
   <thing>Analyzing the problem...</thing>
   
   Or simply use <think>:
   <think>Considering the options...</think>
   
   Your thinking will be shown in a beautiful collapsible section so users can understand your reasoning.

Guidelines for thinking:
- Use for complex problems that require step-by-step analysis
- Show your reasoning process transparently
- Break down the problem into steps
- Consider alternatives when relevant
{% if encourageThinking %}
- ALWAYS use thinking tags for non-trivial requests
